# About the project Order-summary 
Challenge by frontendmentor coded by me saheed sheriff ajibola my third challenge since joining the frontend community.

# Difficulty of the project 
The challenge initially seems difficult for me by merely looking at in but with practice, i found out it caan be done easily with basic html and css properties like positioning(i.e for the inept positioning of internal objects like the music icon)lol Quite easy.

# Challenge posed
The only obstacle is the font-family, i was unable to import the font-family "red hat display" from fonts.google.

# I hope the design is quite similar to the required design

# Bacically i don't see a reason to add a media query as the design is quite similar in both cases
